        <p>Effective emergency response is critical for public safety. This study utilized Python and SQL to clean and analyze a comprehensive dataset of fire and emergency medical service (EMS) calls within Houston, Texas. Our analysis focused on identifying potential bottlenecks in response times, particularly concerning the spatial relationship between incident locations and fire station deployment. A key finding revealed atypical delays in response times for incidents located in close proximity to certain fire stations. This counterintuitive pattern suggests the presence of underlying factors hindering timely intervention in nearby emergencies. While our current analysis identified this critical issue, further investigation requiring additional datasets, including dispatch protocols, detailed geographic and road network information, and unit deployment procedures, is necessary to fully elucidate the causes of these localized delays and inform targeted strategies for improvement.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response systems are crucial in metropolitan areas where incidents can escalate rapidly and put lives at risk. As one of the most populous and diverse cities in the United States, Houston faces unique challenges in emergency response due to its sprawling urban landscape, complex road networks, and diverse socio-economic demographics. The Houston Fire Department (HFD), a vital component of the city’s public safety infrastructure, is tasked with providing rapid and reliable emergency response services across this expansive area.</p>

      <div class="figure">

        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 1. Total Calls per Year (from First Arriver data)</div>
      </div>

      <p>Given the increasing call volumes (Fig 1) and the complexities introduced by urban development, it is imperative for HFD to continuously evaluate and enhance its response strategies. This project aims to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights by leveraging advanced data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Our comprehensive analysis of HFD’s response data from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 will provide a detailed examination of response trends, station performance, and the factors influencing response times. Ultimately, this study aims to support HFD in its mission to deliver timely and efficient emergency services, contributing to the overall safety and well-being of Houston’s residents.</p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>The data (given in .csv format) used for this analysis was provided by Leonard Chan, Houston Fire Department’s Accreditation Manager. Below is each dataset provided and what specifically the data was used for:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Unit Performance Data for 2023 (all 4 quarters)</dt>
        <dd>- This dataset was used to get the specific information about incident calls for the year 2023 (e.g. what type of unit responded, what order stations got to a specific call, etc.). Specifically this dataset was used during the querying of our data.</dd>
        <dt>First Arriver Performance Data for 2019-2023</dt>
        <dd>- This dataset was used to build all of our graphs since it included information about station response time metrics (e.g. location, dates, length of travel, type of call, etc.)</dd>
      </dl>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
      <p>The objectives of this project are designed to address the key operational challenges faced by the Houston Fire Department, focusing on data-driven solutions to improve response times and service delivery. These objectives include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Integration and Cleaning</strong>: To gather, integrate, and preprocess response data from fiscal years 2019 through 2023. This step involves consolidating disparate datasets and handling missing values to create a robust foundation for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>: To conduct a thorough EDA, we identify trends and anomalies in response times across different incident types, periods, and geographic locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Data Visualization</strong>: To create clear, insightful visualizations that communicate complex patterns and trends to stakeholders effectively. Tools like heatmaps, bar charts, and geospatial plots will be utilized to make the data accessible and understandable for city council, HFD Accreditation, and stations themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Indentfication of Operational Bottlenecks</strong>: To pinpoint specific stations, times, and incident types that are associated with longer response times. This analysis will highlight areas that require targeted interventions or resource adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Actionable Recommendations</strong>: To formulate practical recommendations based on the analysis findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>

      <p>Part of our analysis focuses more on the “normal” distribution of the dataset. For this, we combined five years of call data into our study. Analyzing a normal dataset over an abnormal dataset (i.e. 2020 with COVID) gives us the ability to dissect what the data is telling us knowing there are little to no surprising factors that can skew the results.</p>
      <p>When plotting the distribution of all the response times from the dataset, the data is positively skewed (Fig 2). This means the average response time is higher than the middle response time value, skewing the distribution towards higher values. So there are longer response times (i.e. 150 minutes) pulling the mean upwards. To combat this, we will use the median to describe the “typical” value in the middle of the dataset. Our analysis uses two computed measurements to gauge the Houston Fire Department's response time. First, we use the aggregate median response time of all fire stations from 2019-2023 and we also use the aggreggated 90th percentile value of each station’s response time to compare to the City of Houston’s city council response time target. What we explicitly mean by “response time” is the time from when a station engine leaves the station to when it arrives at the incident.</p>

    <div id="seasonalities" class="section">
      <h2>Call Seasonalities</h2>
      <p>Call centers get a large swarm of calls day in and day out. We wanted to identify any seasonal patterns in the dataset for both call frequency and median response time. Houston is a notable city that hosts seasonal events attracting thousands of people, such as RodeoHouston, the Chevron Houston Marathon, and the seasons of city's various professional sports teams. Not only that, there are everyday seasonal activities of daily living; for example, we wanted to see if there is a spike in calls and response time from the school year versus the summertime.</p>
      <p>Identifying specific time periods where fire stations across the Houston metropolitan area are operating with an influx of calls and responding to calls slower can allow us to build an action plan to help stations mitigate the weight of the inundation at that specific time period.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/callsdistributioncurve.png" alt="Distribution of All Calls from 2019-2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 3. Distribution of All Calls from 2019-2023</div>
      </div>

      <p>Looking directly at the raw numbers, the number of calls that come in peaks more towards the months after the middle of the year (i.e. about  July to September) than it does towards the beginning of the year (Fig 3). This can be seen more explicitly in Figure 4, where there is a habitual dip in the number of calls stations receive during February. This can be possibly tied to the lesser number of days in February than in January. The higher call counts come in from June to September, either due to increased outdoor activity and/or hotter temperatures.</p>
      <p><i>NOTE: On February 13-17, 2021, Texas was hit with a winter storm. This caused an unpredictable influx of calls. Because of this, HFD omitted this specific range of data from the dataset, causing the lower call frequency for February 2021.</i></p>
      <p>The year 2023 shows the highest call frequency out of all years, especially in July and August. During this time, Houston recorded record-breaking temperatures in July (an average of 87.8 degrees) and August (an average of 102.7 degrees).</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/callfrequency.png" alt="Monthly Call Frequencies from 2020-2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 4. Monthly Call Frequencies from 2020-2023</div>
      </div>

      <p>Shifting to the weekly distribution of calls, fire stations are getting more calls during the week than on the weekend. More specifically, from 2 PM to 6 PM from Monday to Friday is when fire stations receive the most calls for that day (Fig 5).</p>
      <p>Overall, from 2019-2023, there appears to be no seasonality pattern from month to month, instead, there are sudden crests and troughs throughout the year, i.e. a peak during summertime and dips in the early months of the year.</p>
      <p>The call frequency can tell us how much of a workload stations are generally getting over time. However, response time will specifically tell us how well (or poorly) stations can handle these calls.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/callsduringweek.png" alt="Weekly Call Frequencies">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 5. Weekly Call Frequencies (Aggregated 2019-2023)</div>
      </div>

      <p>Figure 6 shows the median response time for each year from 2019 to 2023, with months defined on the x-axis and median response time (in minutes) on the y-axis. There is an increase in response time as the years go on; more specifically, there is a sudden rise in median response time from 2019 to 2020, which reflects the disruption fire stations experienced after COVID-19. These disruptions can be hits to their staffing levels and/or to the station's resources. Seasonally, there is a notable increase in response times during the summer months, June to August, across most of the years, connecting to the increase in call frequency in the summer months. As the year goes on, there is a consistent, gradual uptrend in response time, which indicates an increase in demand, resource shortages, or other systemic factors</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/medianresponsetime.png" alt="Median Response Time from 2019-2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 6. Median Response Time from 2019-2023</div>
      </div> 
      
      <p>While there seems to be no prominent recurring seasonal pattern at a particular period, the day of the week (weekday versus weekend), and possibly the time of day (i.e. rush hour, lunch rush, etc) can affect the response time. Throughout the year, 3 AM to 5 AM consistently houses the largest response time for that day (Fig 7). The heatmap shows the median response time of all units from 2019-2023 aggregated across a timespan (January through December for Fig 7 and Sunday through Saturday for Fig 8) and hours of the day (0 to 23). In the heatmap, the colormap to the right shows that the median response time (in minutes) ranges from ~6.60 minutes to ~8.00 minutes. From the color spread of the map, it appears that when receiving any call type, a variable such as time of day may be a bigger factor in the final response time than the month of the year. With this, if a call were to come in between 3 AM and 5 AM, we can conclude that the response time at those hours will take longer than any other time throughout the day. To solve a bottleneck like this, we can identify why stations are taking longer to respond. A possible reason is that it is around this time that stations change their shifts, possibly making the shift change process more streamlined so that the transition period doesn’t result in a longer response time. These high response times during the early morning are consistent throughout every day of the week. With a sudden transition to a lower response time at 6 AM, which is in line with when stations have completed their shift changes.</p>

      <h2>Gap Analysis</h2>
      <p>With the Houston Fire Department being one of the largest in the United States, we wanted to identify and analyze any possible bottlenecks at specific stations that might negatively contribute to HFD’s overall response time analysis.</p>
      <p>To effectively pinpoint potential bottlenecks within the Houston Fire Department's response times, we've moved beyond median values and focused on percentile analysis. Percentiles show a bigger picture by showing the distribution of response times. For example, the 90th percentile reveals the time within which 90% of calls are responded to, highlighting the upper range of typical response times and flagging stations where responses are consistently slower. By examining these higher percentiles, we can identify stations where a significant portion of responses exceed expected durations, signaling potential areas for improvement and resource optimization.</p>
      <p>To analyze and access the upper range of typical response times, more specifically the aggregate 90th percentile response time for each station, Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the stations that are ranked from the longest 90th percentile response time on the left to the shortest 90th percentile response time on the right, based on fire calls and EMS/rescue calls. This metric represents the response time that was met or exceeded in only 10% of incidents. The red line in Figure 9 represents the City of Houston’s 90th percentile response time benchmark, specifically for fire calls. The green line in Figure 10 represents the City of Houston’s 90th percentile response time for EMS and rescue calls. These benchmarks are set by the city budget and services as a proxy of community expectations (Table 1).</p>
      <p>The aggregate was used for the 90th percentile metric so we can analyze the <i>overall</i> trends and patterns, this route reduces noise and summarizes group behavior.</p>

      </div>

      <p><i>NOTE: All stations in the graph are non-airport, non-special stations. Station 22-Hazmat, Station 54, Station 99, Station 92, and Station 81 were all removed from the analysis because their call response is special. For example, Station 22 responds to hazmat-specific calls all over Houston because they are a hazmat station, and the other stations are airport stations, responding only to airport calls.</i></p>

        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 9. Order Bar Chart of 90th Percentile Response Times for Fire Calls</div>
      </div>

      <p>Figure 9 shows that a little over half of the stations analyzed are above this benchmark. This indicates that there is a widespread performance gap in fire call response, showing that these delays are not isolated incidents but rather a systemic issue. Conversely, Figure 10 shows that only 15% of the 88 fire stations analyzed exceeded the 90th percentile response time benchmark for EMS calls. This stark contrast suggests that the factors contributing to response time delays are more prevalent in fire-related incidents. The fire stations demonstrate strong abilities to respond to medical emergencies promptly.</p>
      <p>Station 65 stands out as the station with not only the highest 90th percentile response time for fire calls but also the highest 90th percentile value for EMS calls. To note, for fire calls, Station 65’s 90th percentile response time is 3 minutes longer than the next ranked station. This consistent pattern of elevated response time suggests an operational bottleneck or resource limitation specific to this station, which will be explored in the next section.</p>

      <h2>Case Study: A Deep Dive into Station 65</h2>
      <p>Among the 88 stations in our dataset, Station 65 showed the most significant deviations from optimal performance. To truly find the bottlenecks in how and why their response times differ, we wanted to compare stations that are at a measurable benchmark. From Figure 9 and Figure 10, the benchmark used is set by the city council for the city budget, allowing our analysis to have a consensus-based metric to analyze stations. Our case study covers the analysis of Station 65 compared to Station 28 (the station at the benchmark standard for fire calls) and Station 83 (the station at the benchmark standard for EMS calls). This section focuses more on graph visualizations and not the geography of station to incident.</p>
      
      <h3>Fire Calls: Station 65 vs Station 28</h3>
      <p>Station 65’s 90th percentile response time for fire calls is 17.1 minutes, while Station 28’s is 9.5 minutes. Why such a large contrast? The first thing we looked at was how many calls each station received throughout the years. And we see that consistently, Station 65 responds to significantly fewer calls than Station 28, but their 90th percentile response time throughout the years is always 3 to 4 minutes over Station 28 (Fig 11).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/station65_station28.png" alt="Line Graph 90th Percentile Response Time and Call Frequency of Station 65 vs Station 28">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 11. 90th Percentile Response Time and Call Frequency of Station 65 vs Station 28</div>
      </div>
      
      <h3>EMS/Rescue Calls: Station 65 vs Station 83</h3>
      <p>Similarly, when comparing Station 65 and Station 83, we looked at how many calls each station received, and Station 65 received significantly fewer calls than Station 83 (Fig 12).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/station65_station83.png" alt="Line Graph 90th Percentile Response Time and Call Frequency of Station 65 vs Station 83">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 12. 90th Percentile Response Time and Call Frequency of Station 65 vs Station 83</div>
      </div>

      <p>So, despite handling significantly fewer calls compared to Station 28 and Station 83, Station 65 shows consistently higher response times, suggesting potential inefficiencies in its operational processes. This raises critical questions about the nature of the incidents Station 65 does respond to.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="findings" class="section">
      <h2>Response Time Findings</h2>
      <p>Digging deeper into the stations, we wanted to look at what other factors could possibly cause such a long response time for Station 65. Initially, we wanted to look at what calls Station 65 were responding to that took them the longest. For this analysis, we looked at Station 65’s incidents in the First Arriver dataset from 2023 and the top ten slowest response times (Fig 13).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="Graphs/slowest_station65.png" alt="Station 65's Lowest Responded Incidents in 2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 13. Station 65's Lowest 10 Responded Incidents in 2023</div>
      </div>

      <p>The query output shows the longest response times for Station 65, including the type of call, when and where it occurred, how long it took them to respond, and what engine responded to that call.</p>
      <p>Looking at the first call, a Truck Fire on December 15, 2023, an engine from the station was en route at 7:55 PM. It took them 37 minutes to respond, and when mapping the latitude and longitude of the call, it placed it near the station (Fig 14 and Fig 15). Looking at the latitude and longitude values of calls in Figure 13, the calls seem to be roughly in the same area.</p>
      <p><i>NOTE: Looking at calls responded to from Station 65, calls that fall under psychiatric or domestic/assaults (calls that fall under EMS/Rescue) will have a lengthy response time because those calls usually start as police-related. The reason for this is that fire and EMS are allowed on the scene only when it is safe from violent actors before patient care is given.</i></p>
      <p>One thing to talk about is the environment surrounding Station 65. It sits off of Farm Market 1960 Road over Lake Houston. The road is known for having bad traffic, especially during peak hours such as rush hour in the morning and the evening. This can also contribute to the lengthy response time for this station.</p>
      <p><i>NOTE: While this section just covered what the data showed, further analysis and insight on call responses and the context surrounding the calls will need to be researched to give a specific reason as to why calls so close to the station are not being responded to promptly.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div id="key_insights" class="section">
        <h2>Key Insights from EDA</h2>
        <p>Our goal as data analysts is to create visualizations that not only display data but also drive actionable insights. The graphs presented here underscore a critical issue: specific fire stations are experiencing significant delays in responding to calls, demanding immediate attention and targeted interventions.</p>
        <p><i>NOTE: Any recommendations having to do with resource/staff allocation and/or funding are at the discretion of the Houston City Council.</i></p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Based on the analysis of response times and station performance, we recommend the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shift Scheduling</strong>: The analysis of the aggregate response times per hour of the day and the analysis of the worst responding stations reveal opportunities to optimize shift scheduling. Stations should consider implementing staggered shifts or overtime options to ensure adequate staffing during early morning hours and peak hours. Aligning staff availability with these patterns can significantly reduce response delays and improve efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritization</strong>: A system can be implemented to prioritize calls based on severity and potential impact. While all calls need to be responded to, there could be a greater focus on rapid responses for high-priority incidents, such as cardiac arrests, structure fires, and life-threatening car crashes.</li>
        </ul>       
    </div>
    
    <div id="additional_work" class="section">
        <h2>Additional Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>The scope of this research project has not been achieved to its entirety. While we have recommended actionable approaches to reduce the overall and individual station response times. Our findings about the station’s atypical long response times to nearby calls has opened a new Pandora’s Box of questions, needed data analysis, and further insight. This requires further investigation of data not yet provided.</p>

        <h2>Call Seasonalities Summary of Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There are no seasonal patterns tied to specific Houston events such as RodeoHouston, but there are higher call frequencies during the hot, summer months.</li>
            <li>There is a higher call frequency during the weekday than the weekend.</li>
            <li>The median response time for all stations has increased every year.</li>
            <li>There seems to be a sudden peak in response time during the time stations change their shifts.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <br>

        <h2>Gap Analysis Summary of Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on FY2025 target, 52% of stations exceed the city council's benchmark for fire calls, while 15% exceed it for EMS calls.</li>
            <li>Station 65 stands out as the station with the highest values across both graphs, signifying the slowest response times and the most significant performance challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Case Study Summary of Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite handling a significantly lower call volume compared to Station 83 and Station 28 across fire calls and EMS calls, Station 65 consistently shows a higher 90th percentile response time, indicating persistent delays.</li>
            <li>This suggests that Station 65 might have internal operational inefficiencies, such as dispatch delays, slower turnout times, or inefficient routing.</li>
            <li>Although they have fewer calls, they could be handling a higher proportion of complex incidents that require more time.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Response Time Summary of Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Looking at the top slowest response times, there seems to be an unusually high response time for calls that are near the station.</li>
            <li>Call Type 3 (EMS/Rescue) is the most frequent type of call made to fire stations, so lowering these call responses will improve the performance of the station's response time.</li>
            <li>Response times for Station 65 could be adversely affected by its placement on Farm Street 1960 Road, which experiences frequent traffic and congestion, potentially hindering timely arrival at incident scenes.</li>
