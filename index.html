      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response systems are crucial in metropolitan areas where incidents can escalate rapidly and put lives at risk. As one of the most populous and diverse cities in the United States, Houston faces unique challenges in emergency response due to its sprawling urban landscape, complex road networks, and diverse socio-economic demographics. The Houston Fire Department (HFD), a vital component of the city’s public safety infrastructure, is tasked with providing rapid and reliable emergency response services across this expansive area.</p>

      <p>Given the increasing call volumes (Fig 1) and the complexities introduced by urban development, it is imperative for HFD to continuously evaluate and enhance its response strategies. This project aims to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights by leveraging advanced data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Our comprehensive analysis of HFD’s response data from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 will provide a detailed examination of response trends, station performance, and the factors influencing response times. Ultimately, this study aims to support HFD in its mission to deliver timely and efficient emergency services, contributing to the overall safety and well-being of Houston’s residents.</p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>The data (given in .csv format) used for this analysis was provided by Leonard Chan, Houston Fire Department’s Accreditation Manager. Below is each dataset provided and what specifically the data was used for:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Unit Performance Data for 2023 (all 4 quarters)</dt>
        <dd>- This dataset was used to get the specific information about incident calls for the year 2023 (e.g. what type of unit responded, what order stations got to a specific call, etc.). Specifically this dataset was used during the querying of our data.</dd>
        <dt>First Arriver Performance Data for 2019-2023</dt>
        <dd>- This dataset was used to build all of our graphs since it included information about station response time metrics (e.g. location, dates, length of travel, type of call, etc.)</dd>
      </dl>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
      <p>The objectives of this project are designed to address the key operational challenges faced by the Houston Fire Department, focusing on data-driven solutions to improve response times and service delivery. These objectives include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Integration and Cleaning</strong>: To gather, integrate, and preprocess response data from fiscal years 2019 through 2023. This step involves consolidating disparate datasets, han	dling missing values, and standardizing variables to create a robust foundation for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>: To conduct a thorough EDA, identifying trends and anomalies in response times across different incident types, periods, and geographic locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Data Visualization</strong>: To create clear, insightful visualizations that communicate complex patterns and trends to stakeholders effectively. Tools like heat maps, bar charts, and geospatial plots will be utilized to make the data accessible and understandable for decision-makers.</li>
        <li><strong>Indentfication of Operational Bottlenecks</strong>: To pinpoint specific stations, times, and incident types that are associated with longer response times. This analysis will highlight areas that require targeted interventions or resource adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Actionable Recommendations</strong>: To formulate practical recommendations based on the analysis findings. This could include adjusting shift schedules during peak call times, enhancing coverage in high-demand areas, or implementing advanced traffic management systems.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Our analysis uses two metrics to measure the Houston Fire Department's response time. First, we use the aggregate median response time of all fire stations from 2019-2023 and we also use the 90th percentile value of each station’s response time to compare to the City of Houston’s city council target response time benchmark. What we explicitly mean by “response time” is the time from when a station engine leaves the station to when it arrives at the incident. When plotting the distribution of all the response times from the dataset, the data is positively skewed (Fig 2). This means the average response time is higher than the middle response time value, skewing the distribution towards higher values. So there are longer response times (i.e. 150 minutes) pulling the mean upwards. To combat this, we will use the median to describe the “typical” value in the middle of the dataset, this gives a more accurate representation of where the outliers are.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="seasonalities" class="section">
      <h2>Call Seasonalities</h2>
      <p>Call centers get a large swarm of calls day in and day out. We wanted to identify any seasonal patterns in the dataset for both call frequency and median response time. Houston is a notable city that hosts seasonal events attracting thousands of people, such as RodeoHouston, the Chevron Houston Marathon, and the seasons of various professional sports teams. Not only that, there are everyday seasonal activities of daily living; for example, we wanted to see if there is a spike in calls and response time from the school year versus the summertime.</p>
      <p>Identifying specific time periods where fire stations across the Houston metropolitan area are operating with an influx of calls and responding to calls slower can allow us to build an action plan to help stations mitigate the weight of the inundation.</p>
      <p>Part of our analysis focuses more on the “normal” distribution of the dataset. For this, we combined five years of call data into our study. Analyzing a normal dataset over an abnormal dataset (i.e. 2020 with COVID) gives us the ability to dissect what the data is telling us knowing there are little to no surprising factors that can skew the results.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="https://github.com/briannaghinds/hfd-research/blob/main/Graphs/callsdistributioncurve.png" alt="Distribution of All Calls from 2019-2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 3. Distribution of All Calls from 2019-2023</div>
      </div>

      <p>Looking directly at the raw numbers, the number of calls that come in peaks more towards the months after the middle of the year (i.e. about  July to September) than it does towards the beginning of the year (Fig 3). This can be seen more explicitly in Figure 4, where there is a habitual dip in the number of calls stations receive during February. This can be possibly tied to the lesser number of days in February than in January. The higher call counts come in from June to September, either due to increased outdoor activity and/or hotter temperatures.</p>
      <p><i>NOTE: On February 13-17, 2021, Texas was hit with a winter storm. This caused an unpredictable influx of calls. Because of this, this specific range of data has been omitted from the dataset, causing the lower call frequency for February 2021.</i></p>
      <p>The year 2023 shows the highest call frequency out of all years, especially in July and August. During this time, Houston recorded record-breaking temperatures in July (an average of 87.8 degrees) and August (an average of 102.7 degrees).</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="https://github.com/briannaghinds/hfd-research/blob/main/Graphs/callfrequency.png" alt="Monthly Call Frequencies from 2020-2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 4. Monthly Call Frequencies from 2020-2023</div>
      </div>

      <p>Shifting to the weekly distribution of calls, fire stations get more calls during the week than on the weekend. More specifically, from 2 PM to 6 PM from Monday to Friday is when fire stations receive the most calls for that day (Fig 5).</p>
      <p>Overall, from 2019-2023, there appears to be no seasonality pattern from month to month, instead, there are sudden crests and troughs throughout the year.</p>
      <p>The call frequency can tell us how much of a workload stations are generally getting over time. However, response time will specifically tell us how well (or poorly) stations can handle these calls.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="https://github.com/briannaghinds/hfd-research/blob/main/Graphs/callsduringweek.png" alt="Weekly Call Frequencies">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 5. Weekly Call Frequencies (Aggregated 2019-2023)</div>
      </div>

      <p>Figure 6 shows the median response time for each year from 2019 to 2023, with months defined on the x-axis and median response time (in minutes) on the y-axis. There is an increase in response time as the years go on; more specifically, there is a sudden rise in median response time from 2019 to 2020, which reflects the disruption fire stations experienced after COVID-19. These disruptions can be hits to their staffing levels and/or to the station's resources. Seasonally, there is a notable increase in response times during the summer months, June to August, across most of the years, connecting to the increase in call frequency in the summer months. As the year goes on, there is a consistent, gradual uptrend in response time, which indicates an increase in demand, resource shortages, or other systemic factors</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="https://github.com/briannaghinds/hfd-research/blob/main/Graphs/medianresponsetime.png" alt="Median Response Time from 2019-2023">
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 6. Median Response Time from 2019-2023</div>
      </div> 
      
      <p>While there seems to be no prominent recurring seasonal pattern at a particular period, the day of the week (weekday versus weekend), and possibly the time of day (i.e. rush hour, lunch rush, etc) can affect the response time. Throughout the year, 3 AM to 5 AM consistently houses the largest response time for that day (Fig 7). The heatmap shows the median response time of all units from 2019-2023 aggregated across a timespan (January through December for Fig 7 and Sunday through Saturday for Fig 8) and hours of the day (0 to 23). In the heatmap, the colormap to the right shows that the median response time (in minutes) ranges from ~6.60 minutes to ~8.00 minutes. From the color spread of the map, it appears that when receiving any call type, a variable such as time of day may be a bigger factor in the final response time than the month of the year. With this, if a call were to come in between 3 AM and 5 AM, we can conclude that the response time at those hours will take longer than any other time throughout the day. To solve a bottleneck like this, we can identify why stations are taking longer to respond. A possible reason is that it is around this time that stations change their shifts, possibly making the shift change process more streamlined so that the transition period doesn’t result in a longer response time. These high response times during the early morning are consistent throughout every day of the week. With a sudden transition to a lower response time at 6 AM, which is in line with when stations have completed their shift changes.</p>

      <h2>4. Results</h2>
      <p>Our analysis revealed several significant patterns in the data, with implications for both theory and practice in [research domain].</p>
      
      <h3>4.1 Primary Patterns</h3>
      <p>Three primary patterns emerged from our analysis:</p>
      <p><strong>Pattern A:</strong> Characterized by cyclical fluctuations with a periodicity of approximately 14 months, this pattern demonstrated strong correlation with [variable X] (r = 0.78, p < 0.001).</p>
      <p><strong>Pattern B:</strong> Exhibited a linear trend with periodic deviations, particularly pronounced during [specific conditions]. This pattern was significantly associated with [variable Y] (β = 0.65, SE = 0.08).</p>
      <p><strong>Pattern C:</strong> Displayed complex, non-linear characteristics with multiple inflection points. Machine learning models identified this pattern as highly predictive of [outcome Z] (accuracy = 87.3%).</p>

        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 1. Visualization of the three primary patterns identified in the analysis. Pattern A (blue), Pattern B (red), and Pattern C (green) are shown across the five-year study period.</div>
      </div>
      
      <h3>4.2 Pattern Interactions</h3>
      <p>Our analysis also revealed significant interactions between these primary patterns, particularly under [specific conditions]. These interactions manifested as:</p>
      <p>- Amplification effects when Patterns A and B coincided temporally</p>
      <p>- Dampening effects when Pattern C preceded Pattern A by 3-4 months</p>
      <p>- Transformative effects resulting in novel pattern emergence when all three primary patterns converged</p>
      
      <h3>4.3 Contextual Factors</h3>
      <p>Several contextual factors moderated the expression of these patterns, including:</p>
      <p>- Organizational size and structure</p>
      <p>- Industry sector and competitive dynamics</p>
      <p>- Regulatory environment</p>
      <p>- Technological infrastructure</p>
      <p>Multiple regression analysis indicated that these contextual factors explained approximately 62% of the variance in pattern expression (adjusted R² = 0.62).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="case_study" class="section">
      <h2>5. Discussion</h2>
      <p>The patterns identified in this study offer several important insights for understanding data dynamics in [research domain].</p>
      
      <h3>5.1 Theoretical Implications</h3>
      <p>Our findings both support and extend existing theoretical frameworks. The cyclical nature of Pattern A aligns with Johnson's (2015)<span class="citation">2</span> Integrated Pattern Theory, particularly the concept of recursive pattern formation. However, the complex characteristics of Pattern C suggest limitations in current theoretical models, which predominantly assume linear or simple non-linear relationships.</p>
      <p>We propose an extension to existing theories that incorporates the concept of "pattern resonance," which occurs when multiple patterns interact in ways that amplify or transform their individual expressions. This concept may help explain the emergent properties observed when patterns converge under specific contextual conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>5.2 Practical Implications</h3>
      <p>From a practical perspective, these findings suggest several strategies for organizations operating in [research domain]:</p>
      <p>1. <strong>Predictive Monitoring:</strong> Organizations can develop monitoring systems that track early indicators of pattern emergence, particularly for Pattern A, which showed the strongest predictive relationship with [outcome variable].</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Adaptive Response Mechanisms:</strong> Given the cyclical nature of Pattern A, organizations can develop rhythmic response mechanisms that align with these cycles.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Contextual Calibration:</strong> Our findings on contextual factors suggest that organizations should calibrate their strategies based on their specific contextual profile, rather than applying generic approaches.</p>
      
      <h3>5.3 Limitations and Future Research</h3>
      <p>Several limitations should be noted. First, while our dataset was comprehensive, it was primarily drawn from [specific regions/industries], potentially limiting generalizability. Second, the five-year timeframe may not capture longer-term pattern evolutions. Finally, our analytical methods, while advanced, may not fully capture the most complex non-linear relationships.</p>
      <p>Future research should address these limitations by incorporating more diverse data sources, extending the temporal scope of analysis, and developing more sophisticated analytical techniques specifically designed for complex pattern detection. Additionally, comparative studies across different domains would help identify universal pattern principles versus domain-specific manifestations.</p>
